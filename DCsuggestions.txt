>> Interview questions (e.g. JavaScript interview questions) should be covered
    little by little, every day (e.g. 5 per day at the start of class).
    Questions should be answered as soon as the concepts are covered in class
    and then reviewed again when the topic is finished,
    and again at a later date.


>> Class organization
    Classes should be organized so that they are regular and predictable
    (class starts at exact same time every day (9:15), breaks at regular times (e.g. every hour), 
    lunch at regular times (e.g. 12:15 - 1:15), evenly spaced periods 
    of instruction time, homework time starts at same time, etc.)
    >> Class elements:
        -warm up
        -algorithm
        -interview questions
        -main topic


>> Content Presentation
    -Every day there should be a lesson plan with clearly defined objectives
    -All of the exercises/presentations should be prepared and practiced in advance
        so that there is minimal confusion, bugs in code, etc.
    -students should be able to follow along in class, so the pace of instruction should
        be slow enough to accommodate all students
    -content should be recorded and made accessible to all students
    

>> Homework
    -Class material should fully prepare students to complete HW and HW should be relevant to what
    was covered in class. No surprises in HW.
    -HW should be checked and recorded every day, a list should be made of assignments completed
    or not completed and the list should be easily accessible.
    -some minimal feedback should be given, or more if needed
