# Stuff we're covering today

- What is React?
- Setting up your environment
- Introduction to Components
- Intro to props

---
# What is React?

- Open source Javascript Library
- Created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook 
- First deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011
- The "V" in MVC
- Maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations
- Front End 

---
# Some Advantages of React 

- Design simple declarative views for each state in your application
- Encapsulated Components 
- Dynamic properties & state 
- Virtual DOM 
- Completely independent of the rest of your application 
- Can render on the client or server 

---
# Virtual DOM

React abstracts away the DOM and creates its own version which is simplified and only includes the things that you need

- Helps identify which parts have changed 
- Determines how to upload the browswers DOM more efficiently 
- Much more lightweight / Works faster

# Architecture
- Component manage own State 
- One way binding 
- JSX 
- Virtual DOM 
- Component Lifecycle

Model + component = DOM

---
# Development Environment

- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- React Redux ES6 Snippets (VS Code Plugin)

---

# [Maps](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp) 
- The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.
- The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.

```react 
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

```
- __currentValue__	Required. The value of the current element
- __index__ Optional. The array index of the current element
- __arr__ Optional. The array object the current element belongs to

# Getting Started


---
# Libraries needed for react to work
- React – the React top level API
- React DOM – adds DOM-specific methods
- Babel – a JavaScript compiler that lets us use ES6+ in old browsers

# JSX 

As you’ve seen, we’ve been using what looks like HTML in our React code, but it’s not quite HTML. This is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.
<br>

With JSX, we can write what looks like HTML, and also we can create and use our own XML-like tags. Here’s what JSX looks like assigned to a variable.
```react 
const heading = <h1 className="site-heading">Hello, React</h1>;
```
---

Using JSX is not mandatory for writing React. Under the hood, it’s running createElement, which takes the tag, object containing the properties, and children of the component and renders the same information. 
The below code will have the same output as the JSX above.

```react
const heading = React.createElement(
    'h1',
    {className: 'site-heading'},
    'Hello, React!'
);
```

# Updating the Rendered Element

- React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. 
- With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render()

# create-react-app

# Tools

```react 

npm install -g create-react-app 
```

```react 

create-react-app my-app  //name must be all lowercase
```

```react 

npm install
```

```react 

npm start
```

## Index.js file

<div class="imgs2">
    <img width="700px"  src="Images/React/React1.png" class="pic">
</div>

- First argument of ReactDom.render can be a component
- __registerServiceWorker()__ is a web API that helps you cache your assets and other files so that when the user is offline or on slow network, he/she can still see results on the screen

# React Component

- Every react app has at least one component
    - The root component named App in App.js 
    - Extends the component class provided by React library
- Components are the basic building blocks of React applications
- Controls a portion of the screen, a view - through its association JSX template
- We define our component's application logic inside of a class 
- The class interacts with the view through properties and methods

<div class="imgs">
    <img width="500px"  src="Images/React/render.png">
</div>

.leftJustify[

- Just a Javascript function that returns code that will be rendered
- In React, implementing the __render__ method is required
- When called, it should return a single React element
    - This element can be either a representation of a native DOM component, such as <div /> or a composite component that you've defined yourself
- render method converts the JSX code into HTML when the component's view is rendered
- Only one main element is returned.  Elements must be nested inside of a parent element

# Working with Components
---
# Creating a new component

```react 
import React, { Component } from 'react';


class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;

```

# Embedding Expressions in JSX

You can embed Javascript expressions in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. For example,
we can define functions, properties and render them in the output.

```react
class App extends React.Component {
    formatName(user){
        return user.firstName + " " + user.lastName;
    }
    render(){
        const user = {
            firstName: 'Veronica',
            lastName: 'Lino'
        }
        return(

            <div>
                <h1>Hello, {this.formatName(user)}</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

```
---
# Embed Javascript expression in an attribute 

```react

<img src={user.imageURL}</img>
```

---
# Displaying a list

```react

const products = ['shampoo', 'soap', 'coolaid', 'milk', 'eggs'] 
const listProducts = products.map(product => {
    <li key={product.toString()}>{product}</li>
})

return(
    <div>
        <ul>{listProducts}</ul>
    </div>
)
```

---
# Props 

- we can pass data into a component by passing in a single object called **props**

Parent
```react
<App name="Veronica" />
```

Parent
```react
Inside of Name component

render(){
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>{this.props.name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

---

# About Props 

- props are read-only (immutable)
    - when we access props in our components, we must never change them

```react 
//don't do this!
{this.props.rating++}
```

So how do we make our page dynamic and change over time?
